# My First NFT Dapp Project

My First NFT Dapp Project is a decentralized application built with ReactJS and Solidity that enables users to launch and mint their own non-fungible token (NFT) projects. 

## How It Works 

The Dapp provides an easy-to-use interface for users to create and launch their NFT projects. Once a project has been created, users can mint their unique NFTs and add them to the project's collection. 

The smart contract is responsible for managing the NFT project and ensuring that all transactions are secure and immutable. Users can interact with the smart contract through the Dapp's user interface, which provides a user-friendly experience.

## Features

- Create and launch your own NFT project
- Mint and create unique NFTs for your project
- Manage your NFT project easily through the Dapp's interface 
- Secure and immutable transactions thanks to smart contract technology

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
